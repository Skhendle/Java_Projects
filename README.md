# Java_Projects
This repository is for projects I do for refining and enhancing my Java Skills.

#*TaskOne*

Count positive and negative numbers and compute
the average of numbers. Write a program that reads an
unspecified number of integers, determines how many
positive and negative values have been read, and
computes the total and average of the input values.
Your program ends with the input 0. Display the
average as a floating-point number.

#*TaskTwo*
Write a program that prompts the user to enter the
number of students and each studentâ€™s name and
score, and finally displays the name of the student with
the highest score
