# Java_Projects
This repository is for projects I do for refining and enhancing my Java Skills.

#*TaskOne*

Count positive and negative numbers and compute
the average of numbers. Write a program that reads an
unspecified number of integers, determines how many
positive and negative values have been read, and
computes the total and average of the input values.
Your program ends with the input 0. Display the
average as a floating-point number.

#*TaskTwo*

Write a program that prompts the user to enter the
number of students and each student’s name and
score, and finally displays the name of the student with
the highest score

#*TaskThree*

Design an “Account” class. The class will have fields id(int), balance(double), annualInterestRate(double), and a “ Date “ field named dateCreated(just use Date date = new Date() ). It will have two constructors, a no argument constructor that will create a default account and a constructor with arguments id, balance, annualInterestRate, and Date, that will create an account with the specified parameters. All fields are private and will have getters and setters, except the date field which will not have a setter only a getter. You will also create a withdraw method to withdraw money from the account, a deposit method to add money to the account.
