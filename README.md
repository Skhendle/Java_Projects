# Java_Projects
This repository is for projects I do for refining and enhancing my Java Skills.
With some question from the Udemy course: [Become A Professional Java Developer From Scratch.](https://www.udemy.com/course/become-a-professional-java-developer-from-scratch/)

## **TaskOne**

### **Objectives:** I/O, conditionals statements and loops.

### **Question:**    
Count positive and negative numbers and compute
the average of numbers. Write a program that reads an
unspecified number of integers, determines how many
positive and negative values have been read, and
computes the total and average of the input values.
Your program ends with the input 0. Display the
average as a floating-point number.

## **TaskTwo**

### **Objectives:** I/O, conditionals statements and loops.

### **Question:** 
Write a program that prompts the user to enter the
number of students and each student’s name and
score, and finally displays the name of the student with
the highest score

## **TaskThree**

### **Objectives:** Basics of classes and their functionality

### **Question:** 
Design an “Account” class. The class will have fields id(int), balance(double), annualInterestRate(double), and a “ Date “ field named dateCreated(just use Date date = new Date() ). It will have two constructors, a no argument constructor that will create a default account and a constructor with arguments id, balance, annualInterestRate, and Date, that will create an account with the specified parameters. All fields are private and will have getters and setters, except the date field which will not have a setter only a getter. You will also create a withdraw method to withdraw money from the account, a deposit method to add money to the account.

## **TaskFour**

### **Objectives:** Inheritance and Polymorphism

### **Question:** 
Design a “ Person “ class. The class will have fields
name, last name, age, and address. Those fields are
going to be private and you will also create getters and
setters in order to modify those fields. Create two
constructors, one with no arguments which will set
those fields to any value that you wish and other
constructor with arguments name, last name, age and
address to set up all those fields.


## **TaskFive**

### **Objectives:** Abstract classes

### **Question:** 

1. Design a class named “ Student “ that will inherit
from the “ Person “ class that you created in exercises
in chapter 3. The new class will also have fields
studentID, semester(which will tell at which semester is
that student (max 8)), major(which will tell what the
student is studying), and department(which will tell at
which department of the college is the student
studying). The class will have a no argument
constructor, and also a constructor that will initialize all
those variables and it will also class the super() to
initialize the variables of the super class. It will also
have getters and setters for all of those fields.

2. Design a class named “ Instructor “ that will inherit
from the “ Person “ class that you created in exercises
in chapter 3. The new class will have instructorID,
degree(which will tell if the instructor has a bachelor,
master or PHD), classesTeaching(which will tell how
many classes is the instructor teaching), major(which
will tell what is the instructor teaching),
department(which will tell at which department of the
university is the instructor teaching),
yearsWokring(which will tell how many years is the
instructor working at the university), salary(which will
tell the salary of the instructor). The class will have a no
argument constructor, and also a constructor that will
initialize all those variables and it will also class the
super() to initialize the variables of the super class. It
will also have getters and setters for all of those fields.

## **TaskSix**

### **Objectives:** Exception Handling in Java

### **Question:** 

1. NumberFormatException - Write a program that will
calculate two numbers, it can be division, multiplication
etc, and displays the result to the user. The program
terminates when you type a non numeric character.
NOTE: Write this program using exception handling,
and then write this program without using exception
handling to achieve the same objective.

3. ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException - Write a program
that meets the following requirements:
■ Creates an array with 100 randomly chosen
integers.
■ Prompts the user to enter the index of the array, then
displays the corresponding element value.
If the specified index is out of bounds, display the
message Out of Bounds .

#**Note: Could not manage to contine executing the program after throwing the exception for the first question**
